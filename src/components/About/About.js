        <h1>Getting to Know Me</h1>
        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <p>
            I graduated from the University of Alberta with a specialization in
        Cell Biology. Unfortunately, when I graduated, covid was still quite
        rampant and the job market was slow. But, I was still able to get my first
        full-time job as the Medical Office Manage at a denture clinic.
        Although not really relating to my degree, I still took the opportunity to
        start my professional career and learn what I could. I was introduced to
        the world of coding with Python as my first language. My interest and
        fascination with coding continued and the chance to learn more at
        General Assembly had come. Through their Software Engineering Immersive
        Bootcamp, I was able to explore more languages and stacks, improve my
        skills and knowledge through labs, and apply each unit's content to
        personalized apps! Now that I have finished this exciting new chapter in
        my life, I'm looking forward to finding a company that will help me
        continue to hone these skills and grow as a developer.

        <h3>What I Bring</h3>
        <p>
            I look forward to adding my kind, bubbly self to any workplace. I
            have a hard working attitude and a desire to learn and grow both
            professionally and personally. Working with others is always something
            to look forward to, but I can also work well on my own! Communication is
            a key attribute for me as I have been developing this skill through 8+
            years of customer service. I enjoy building connections with clients
            and coworkers as we journey towards our mutual goal. In the case of
            software development, I look forward to making practical, aesthetically
            pleasing apps that bring out the client's unique business and
            personality!
        </p>
        <h3>Other Interests</h3>
        <p>
            Outside the working world, I enjoy being active, reading, and watching
            shows and movies. I try to keep active by working out, dancing, and
            playing basketball. For books, I enjoy reading fictional novels, manga and
            webcomics. I can be found mainly watching k-dramas, anime, and sit-coms,
            but I am always willing to try new shows/genres. For movies, I am your
            typical rom-com fan, but am open to watch horror, comedy, and action. I love
            trying new things and seeing what the world has to offer!
