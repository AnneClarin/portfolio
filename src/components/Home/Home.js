            Hi there, thanks for stopping by!
            My name is Anne Clarin and I am a software developer based in Calgary, AB, Canada.
            I love making apps that not only look aesthetically pleasing,
            but can be used to improve your day-to-day life!
            I'm always in awe when the code takes you from a blank screen to a beautiful,
            fully-function application. See below for more about me!
        </div>
    </section>
