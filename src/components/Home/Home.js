        <p>
        I am a software developer based in Calgary, AB, Canada. <br/>
        I love making apps that not only look aesthetically pleasing,
        but can be used to improve your day-to-day life! <br/>
        I'm always in awe when the code takes you from a blank screen to a beautiful,
        fully-function application. <br/>
        See below for more about me!

      </div>
    </section>
